# The HEED Renewable Energy Recommendations Tool (RERT)
The first version (v1) of the tool was built by Scene Connect with support from Coventry University and Practical Action between June 2018 and August 2019. 

It aims to provide technology recommendations based on energy-economic-environment-health performance indicators to provide support for how best to increase energy access in refugee camps and improve sustainability for:
1. Cooking Energy
2. Household Lighting and Electricity
3. Community/Camp central Lighting and Electricity.

Users engage with an Excel spreadsheet where they answer questions to describe the population of the camp, as well as the camp energy infrastructure and energy use of families therein. They can also enter technical data for particular renewable energy and cooking options. This allows the user to localise the results into the local context as much as possible. 

Results are presented in the form of an indicator dashboard where different technology options can be compared with their performance indicator scoring.

For a user guide and technical documentation, please visit this site <https://heedproject.github.io/rert/>

There is also a [pdf](https://github.com/heedproject/rert/blob/gh-pages/RERT_Documentation.pdf) version of this documentation.

These pages get automatically updated with any changes made to the markdown documentation on the master branch.

**Note: The tool has been built with Excel 2018 and Excel 2019 versions. It is not backwards compatible with older versions at this time. Please use recent versions of Microsoft Excel to use it.**
