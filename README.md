# The HEED Renewable Energy Recommendations Tool (RERT)
The first version (v1) of the tool was built by Scene Connect with support from Coventry University and Practical Action between June 2018 and August 2019. 

It aims to provide technology recommendations based on energy-economic-environment-health performance indicators to provide support for how best to increase energy access in refugee camps and improve sustainability for:
1. Cooking Energy
2. Household Lighting and Electricity
3. Community/Camp central Lighting and Electricity.

Users engage with an Excel spreadsheet where they answer questions to describe the population of the camp, as well as the camp energy infrastructure and energy use of families therein. They can also enter technical data for particular renewable energy and cooking options. This allows the user to localise the results into the local context as much as possible. 

Results are presented in the form of an indicator dashboard where different technology options can be compared with their performance indicator scoring.

Please see the [User Guide](RERT_User_Guide_v1.2.pdf) for a better understanding of how to use the tool.

Feel free to use the tool and contribute to its ongoing development using github issues and pull requests.
