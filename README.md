# The HEED Renewable Energy Recommendations Tool (RERT)
*The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the  Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) for funding  the Humanitarian Engineering and Energy for Displacement (HEED) project as part of the Global Challenges Research Fund  (EP/P029531/1). The authors would like to acknowledge and thank project delivery partners Practical Action and Scene Connect for their  significant role in co-ordinating in-camp activities and providing technical inputs and tools. We would also like to recognise the  support of MIDIMAR (Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugees) and UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees)* *and the* *contributions of the Global Plan of Action, Chatham House, and the RE4R (Renewable Energy for Refugees)  Project (a partnership between Practical Action and UNHCR, supported by  the IKEA Foundation).* 

The first version (v1) of the tool was built by Scene Connect with support from Coventry University and Practical Action between June 2018 and August 2019. 

It aims to provide technology recommendations based on energy-economic-environment-health performance indicators to provide support for how best to increase energy access in refugee camps and improve sustainability for:
1. Cooking Energy
2. Household Lighting and Electricity
3. Community/Camp central Lighting and Electricity.

Users engage with an Excel spreadsheet where they answer questions to describe the population of the camp, as well as the camp energy infrastructure and energy use of families therein. They can also enter technical data for particular renewable energy and cooking options. This allows the user to localise the results into the local context as much as possible. 

Results are presented in the form of an indicator dashboard where different technology options can be compared with their performance indicator scoring.

There is also a [pdf](https://github.com/heedproject/rert/blob/gh-pages/RERT_Documentation.pdf) version of this documentation.

A webinar setting out the RERT rationale, purpose and functionality, as well as a short question and answer session, may be found [here](https://youtu.be/kW9I00c73fU) 

These pages get automatically updated with any changes made to the markdown documentation on the master branch.

**Note: The tool has been built with Excel 2018 and Excel 2019 versions. It is not backwards compatible with older versions at this time. Please use recent versions of Microsoft Excel to use it.**

Feel free to use the tool and contribute to its ongoing development using github issues and pull requests. If you are not familiar with github, [please read this guide on how to collaborate on projects.](https://help.github.com/en/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests)
