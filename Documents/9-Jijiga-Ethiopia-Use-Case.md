## **Overview** 

This document supports the Renewable Energy Recommendations Tool (RERT) produced as part of the Humanitarian Energy and Engineering for Development (HEED) research project. It provides a use case scenario to guide RERT users through the process of using the tool. The use case is particular to the assessment and recommendation of energy access at Kebri Beyah Refugee Camp, Ethiopia undertaken by Mercy Corps up to February 2020.

The purpose of this document is to provide a comparative assessment of the RERT against a parallel in-camp assessment at Kebri Beyah Refugee Camp, conducted by Mercy Corp.

**About Humanitarian Energy and Engineering for Development (HEED)**

The HEED project is an innovative response to growing recognition of the need to improve access to energy, particularly renewable energy sources, for populations displaced by conflict and natural disasters. The focus of HEED is on the lived experiences in three refugee camps in Rwanda (Nyabiheke, Gihembe and Kigeme) and internally displaced persons (IDPs) forced to leave their homes as a result of the 2015 earthquake in Nepal.

**Renewable Energy Recommendations Tool (RERT)**

The RERT was built by Scene Connect with support from Coventry University and Practical Action between June 2018 and April 2019. It aims to provide technology recommendations based on 23 performance indicators to increase energy access in refugee camps and improve sustainability for:

1.  Cooking Energy;

2.  Household Lighting and Electricity;

3.  Community/Camp central Lighting and Electricity.

Users engage with an Excel spreadsheet where they answer questions to describe the population of the camp and the social and economic situation, as well as the camp energy infrastructure and energy use of families therein. They can also enter technical data for particular renewable energy options.

## **Use Case Scenario**

The purpose of providing a use case scenario is to give tool users a practical guide through a real-world example of using the tool in a humanitarian setting. The following evaluation details how to:

1. **Input data** on current energy utilisation in Kebri Beyah, Ethiopia;

2. **Interpret baseline energy use** outcomes from the tool, including economic and environmental analyses;

3. **Define what level of energy access** has been achieved, based on the ESMAP multi-tier energy access matrices;

4. **Understand tool recommendations** for cookstove interventions in a specific context;

5. **Set boundary criteria** and alter specific parameters of the tool.

6. **Compare tool outputs** with survey analysis and recommendations made by in-country consultants.

A special focus of this case provide an understanding of how the RERT compares to real-world feasibility assessments for energy interventions, where the RERT tool is best suited in the assessment process, the limitations of the tool and potential improvements which would benefit the tool in future.

### **Mercy Corps**
Mercy Corps is a global team of humanitarians, working together on current crises across more than 40 countries around the world. Through 6,000 staff members Mercy Corps works directly with people living through poverty, disaster, violent conflict and the acute impacts of climate change. Mercy Corps has been working in Ethiopia since 2004. Ethiopia is Africa’s second-most populous nation, and although the economy has been steadily growing, the vast majority of Ethiopia remains impoverished. More than 83 percent of the population lives in rural areas vulnerable to droughts caused by climate change as well as economic instability and conflict spill over from neighbouring Somalia and South Sudan.

In February 2020, Mercy Corp conducted on the ground energy assessments across three refugee camps in the Jijiga district of Ethiopia. The assessments are based on surveys of 413 households, focus group discussions and key informant interviews within the camps to understand energy access and needs, alongside a technical assessment of electrical loads and cooking patterns within the camps. The purpose of the assessment was to define current energy access and use, towards defining the viability and cost of future energy interventions in the camps. This included assessment of solar home systems, microgrids and improved cooking solutions, as well as financing and enabling mechanisms for implementation of interventions.

### **Kebri Beyah Refugee Camp**
Ethiopia is a country with a history of hosting refugees and has been maintaining an open-door asylum policy of giving humanitarian access and protection to the neediest. Ethiopia hosts 920,000 refugees and most are accommodated in 26 refugee camps with limited services and opportunities and depend largely on humanitarian assistance. Almost 99% of the fleeing communities are from its neighbours – Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan and Eritrea.

The Somali region is the poorest and most conflict-affected region of Ethiopia. The Human Development Index (HDI) score is the lowest in Somali. The Somali region hosts the largest refugees in Fafan zone. The three camps in the Jigjiga district are in the north eastern part of Ethiopia, bordering Somalia, comprising of three different refugee camps with a total refugee population of 36,916.

The Kebri Beyah camp was established in 1991 for Somali refugees fleeing the civil war in their country. The camp is not organized, and the refugee housing is mixed with that of the host community. In the satellite image below (see Figure 5), the refugee settlement is demarcated in orange, with the host community adjacent. In Kebri Beyah, the administrating offices of the agencies are not located in the same area of the camp except for those of the ARRA and UNHCR. While both offices have grid connectivity, it is not reliable and outages of 4-8 hours every day are a common feature. Since the refugee HHs are located along with those of the host communities, individuals of the host community extend their grid lines and provide electricity supply for a fee. A separate kitchen area is marked within the premises, Households cook using a three stone fire or the traditional charcoal stove.

## **Cooking Analysis & Results**
This section provides an overview of the current cooking situation in Kebri Beyah (i.e. the baseline situation), detailing the processes involved in using the RERT and the recommendations provided by the tool.

### **Baseline Situation**
The baseline cooking situation in Kebri Beyah is between tier 0 – 1 in terms of energy acess, with most of camp residents surveyed<sup>1</sup> using firewood or charcoal in basic 3-stone fires (23%), charcoal stoves (16%) and Tikili charcoal stoves<sup>2</sup> ) (7%). A further 4% of residents used kerosene stoves for cooking. The average cost of fuel within the study sample was 310 ETB/week. Residents were found to be aspirational towards use of Charcoal Tikikil, kerosene or ethanol stoves and few respondents highlighted electric stoves as an aspiration.

Using these metrics, the RERT tool was input with the baseline information shown in table 1 (see associated RERT_Tool_v1_JIJIGA for further information). The study considered several key decision-making criteria to ensure that the scenario ambitions remained reasonable, including:

 -  **Energy access tier 2**, in line with camp resident ambitions;
 -  **Rational total investment cost** (101,710 ETB);
 -  **Affordability of cooking fuel** at camp level and household level;
 -   Targeting **improvements in emissions and health**.

The scenario criteria detailed below is an attempt to balance these aims, whilst achieving a marked improvement in camp-wide cooking improvements. It is worth noting that high household costs for purchase of tier 2 stoves and fuel would likely require funding from the camp authority or external stakeholders.

### **Cooking Recommendations**
Based on the above criteria, the below recommendations were provided by the RERT. To achieve energy access tier 2, fired clay wood / charcoal stoves or, with significantly more investment, improved wood fuel stoves are recommended.

Implementation of both fired clay (Woodfuel) and fired clay (charcoal) stoves would improve energy access tier (0.5 - > 2), reduce monthly cooking costs (50 - 60% across the camp), reduce carbon emissions (50 – 60%), reduce deforestation risks, reduce monthly costs of fuel at the household level (30 - 45%), reduce household CO2 emissions (55 – 70%) and reduce associated health risks (very high -> high).

Whilst improved cookstoves are potentially more impactful that fired clay cookstoves, the high investment costs, low household affordability and negligible additional benefits mean it is a less recommended intervention by the RERT. The implementation of improved cookstoves would be dependent on the final product specification and support (i.e. funding, grants) available for implementation.

It is worth noting that within the bounds of the scenario criteria (table 1), the tool could not find technology interventions which would fulfil all criteria. An example of this is the inability to meet the medium health risk criteria within the bounds of the wider scenario criteria.

## Household Electricity
This section provides an overview of the current electricity access and provision situation in Kebri Beyah (i.e. the baseline situation), detailing the processes involved in using the RERT and the recommendations provided by the tool.

### Household Scenario Inputs
Currently Kebri Beyah has relatively good electricity access, with 80% of households connected via wired networks. Primarily, power is provided via national grid connections via host community households or by diesel generators run by private operators. Of the 20% without a wired connection, 28% of households have some form of dry cell battery storage, and 33% have solar lanterns. Candles and solar home systems (SHS) were not evident in the camps, with the lack of spares and repairs for SHS and high initial costs attributed for the lack of SHS uptake.

On average, households receive 5 – 8 hours of grid electricity in Kebri Beyah, primarily in the evening and night hours. Electricity is delivered via informal connections to host households for a monthly flat fee. Diesel-source energy is charged at ~30 ETB per bulb and 90 – 100 ETB per larger appliance (e.g. televisions). Households were found to have 3 bulbs and one larger appliance on average – an average of ~200 ETB / week. Grid and private generation are not reliable in Kebri Beyah, therefore the average hours of electricity does not reflect levels of system breakdown / grid failure in the camp, which can be regular and occasionally long-term.

Dominant camp resident aspirations were to have access to or be able to afford enough electricity to routinely use entertainment (e.g. speakers, tv) or a mixer grinder in their kitchen. Furthermore, consistent and reliable phone charging and access to in-home sockets were seen as priorities by camp residents. Charging costs for residents can be between 3 – 10 ETB for mobile phones and up to 20 ETB for larger appliances (e.g. laptops).

Based on the above data, the scenario data set out in table 3 was defined, including achievable initial investment costs but focusing particularly on lowering electricity costs and improving reliability and affordability for camp households.

[[media/Jijiga/Table 3 - Jijiga HH electricity 1.png]]

### Household Recommendations
Based on the previous criteria, the RERT recommends implementation of centralised wind or a combination of wind / solar PV alongside lithium-ion batteries. These are high cost interventions, selected due the fact that any system implemented in Kebri Beyah would be competing with an established diesel and national grid supplied electricity system. The RERT does not account for the quality of supply from generation sources, using average hours/day and hours/evening to calculate appropriate interventions.

Whilst high cost, the recommended interventions achieve several goals, including greater available energy and negligible CO2 emissions. All of these systems could be implemented in a way which reaches those without current wired electricity sources, as well as providing marked improvements in safety (in comparison to informal host household connections which often lack any wiring protection or switches), lowering costs (in comparison  to current tariffs for grid and / or diesel electricity purchase) and providing more robust energy service provision.

Affordability is very low across the board for household electricity solutions, due to the high initial cost of both centralised and decentralised options, although camp supported, or subsidised, electricity provision could bring costs in line with household incomes.

## Central Camp Electricity

### Baseline Situation
Camp facilities, including the camp administration offices, accommodation buildings (2), health centre (1) and school buildings (2), are powered by a mixture of regional grid electricity (when available) and diesel generators (including camp authority run and private run generators). At present 3 diesel generators provide electricity to camp buildings, totalling 34 kW of capacity.

With sufficient energy access, the focus of this section is to define interventions which meet wider criteria than improvements in energy access alone. This includes lower running costs, CO2 emissions reductions and system robustness (e.g. backup solutions). To this end, scenario criteria were set to ensure affordable running costs and emissions reductions, whilst not limiting costs.

[[media/Jijiga/Table 5 - Jijiga Camp electricity 1.png]]

### Camp Recommendations
The recommendations provided all centre on low carbon solutions, including 100% solar, 100% wind and multi-technology solutions. All recommendations included battery backup systems due to the intermittent grid issues at Kebri Beyah camp. All recommendations show a complete reduction in fuel emissions, though it is worth noting that any intervention would have a carbon cost associated to the procurement and deployment of new technologies.

The major defining factor across the recommendations is cost. Solar PV is both the cheapest option and has the lowest operational cost per year. This reflects similar projects in the humanitarian sector, where solar PV is preferred for refugee camp situations. The addition of wind energy generation would provide some robustness to the energy system when solar irradiation is low, although an element of backup is already included for these situations through energy storage. Wind is significantly more expensive and increases operational costs, reducing its viability in this scenario.

## Use Case Conclusions

The below section compares the recommendations and outputs of the RERT, as detailed in the previous section, against energy interventions recommended by Mercy Corp consultants through engagement and surveying with camp residents and authorities at Kebri Beyah. The purpose of this section is to detail the commonalities and differences between each approach, demonstrating the effectiveness of the RERT and providing a platform for future changes and improvements to the tool.

### Comparative assessment

Table 7 sets out the recommendations as set out in the RERT and by the in-camp assessment. A discussion of the recommendations is provided below.

[[media/Jijiga/Table 7 - Jijiga Recommendations.png]]

### Household Cooking
The RERT defined solutions which are feasible and provide energy access improvements in Kebri Beyah, although there is a lack of ambition in comparison to the in-camp assessment. The key reason for this is that the tool was instructed to target energy tier 2 (a significant jump from the original 0.5) and to make stoves affordable to households. The RERT did not consider electricity access for electric stoves, which greatly increases the feasibility of such solutions.

The in-camp assessment suggests that the biggest barriers to uptake are not technical or even purely financial, although costs of stoves and fuel are big pressures on camp households. The building of awareness of modern cooking solutions was defined as a key barrier, as well as the creation of stronger supply chains for alternative fuels (e.g. ethanol). The main recommendation of the assessment was to conduct a pilot trial with 50 households using electric stoves alongside a microgrid system, as defined in the following household electricity assessment.

In this case, the social drivers, supply chain considerations and synergies between projects (i.e. microgrid -> electric stoves) are not calculated in the RERT, leading to differing recommendations. The RERT interventions are reasonable high-level assumptions but the on-the-ground picture is more complex, with opportunities to define more ambitious projects and more robust local energy systems.

### Household Electricity
In line with recommendations from the in-country assessment, the RERT does not recommend use of smaller decentralised solutions, such as solar home systems. These systems were deemed unaffordable to most camp residents and a poor alternative to the current level of energy access (tier 2) from grid electricity and diesel generation.

The RERT recommends suitable solutions for the context, where grid connectivity is high, but system robustness and performance are poor. Solar PV and / or wind capacity with lithium-ion storage would be feasible in a centralised manner but would require improvement and upgrades to the current grid infrastructure. Due to the high costs of the deployment, it is uncertain whether the recommended intervention could cost compete with the current grid / diesel generation mix. In all likelihood, central funding with subsidised tariffing would be necessary to implement such ambitious systems.

The in-country assessment does not provide exact recommendations on the best approach to improving household electricity access, focusing more on the barriers to deployment of specific technologies. The critical issues highlighted include household energy cost, system performance and safety. Whilst the RERT recommendations proposed would address cost and performance, these are not functions within the model. Improvements to how costs are dealt with (e.g. suggested tariffing levels / household costs), performance (e.g. number of households reached, backup capacity or time) and safety (e.g. cost of wiring, lighting and socket upgrades) would improve the specificity and applicability of tool outputs.

### Central Camp Electricity
The in-camp assessment does not include an assessment of central camp buildings, focusing only on household energy. With a highly connected electricity system in Kebri Beyah, it seems likely that all camp buildings would have sufficient access to electricity, though limited by system performance. The RERT recommendations are suitable low carbon solutions but are relatively high cost. This means they are unlikely to be cost-effective when considering camp buildings alone. It is likely that a system deployed at Kebri Beyah would include provision of energy to households, businesses and central camp buildings.

There are no solar streetlights currently operating at Kebri Beyah. This would be a low cost, low carbon intervention but would require cost comparison against utilising the existing grid to power streetlights. One possible improvement to the RERT tool in this assessment would be to include a breakdown of potential societal benefits (e.g. safety, later working hours, community spirit/cohesion) which may be influenced by solar street lights and improved electricity availability at key camp locations.
